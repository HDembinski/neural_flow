# Neural flow

This project was originally forked from [PZFlow](https://github.com/jfcrenshaw/pzflow) by [John Franklin Crenshaw](jfcrenshaw@gmail.com), but largely rewritten. PZFlow itself draws from other repositories, see the PZFlow documentation.

This library implements bijectors as FLAX modules.
